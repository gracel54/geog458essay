## Introduction

I decided to look into the [Lexington, KY Foodscape Mapping Project](https://github.com/ljmoser83/lex-foodscape) by Lee Moser. On his Github profile he states that he is “a native Kentuckian with personal and professional interests in environmental science and the conservation of natural resources.” This project was made with the intention of looking into food resources around Lexington, Kentucky and guide residents’ decisions surrounding where they decide to get their food. This being said, the audience is primarily going to be residents of Lexington KY, but could also be used by researchers looking into food deserts or companies looking to expand their locations. The data was gathered from the (Lexington Fayette County Urban Government (LFUCG) Health Department's food protection database)[https://lexingtonhealthdepartment.org/food-protection/]. In terms of web map functions, it is interactive and allows users to find out information about healthy food options near them. There is a legend depicting what type of food provider a location is, as well as a side panel full of information about the map.

## System Architecture

This web map was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses the leaflet library to create the map, similar to the methods we’ve used throughout the quarter. It uses a variety of leaflet functions to visualize various aspects of the data (markers, zoom function, legend, etc.). The hover function is also used, as when a user hovers over a point with their cursor, the name of the business is displayed. It also utilizes the bootstrap library to incorporate responsive design. It also uses the fontawesome library for the icons in the map panel. The web page itself uses APIs from Twitter and Facebook to integrate sharing options to their respective platforms, which can be seen at the top of the page (or after clicking the menu page on mobile/smaller screens). The data is stored in a data folder on Github and consists of several .csv, .xlsx, and various geospatial data formats (geoJSON and shapefiles). The project seems to have originally used a basemap from mapbox, but it is currently unavailable.

## Usability

The map’s thematic layer utilizes marker clusters which contains the number of food services in a given area. As the map is zoomed in, these numbers become smaller and we are able to see the individual restaurants/businesses. As the map is zoomed out, points converge into one, with a color based on the number of points aggregated. Green appears to be a small amount, yellow indicates a moderate amount, while orange indicates a large amount. If the size of the point fluctuated with the number of points converged into it would be more helpful for visibility, especially as larger points represent 30+ businesses. The basemap does not seem to load properly (browsers tested include: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Safari). This, along with the lack of a scale bar, has made it impossible to understand the distances between one business and another. The map also does not have other traditional aspects, like the North Star. Attributions are in the side panel instead of the bottom corners of the map. From the screenshot posted on the github, it was intended to be a basemap similar to OpenStreetMap; it shows major highways, greenery, and keeps the rest of the map a neutral color. This works fine for its purpose; any more details would make the map overwhelming. A picture of what the basemap looked like is displayed below:

There is a leaflet panel on the left side of the map with 3-4 icons; one for instructions, map tools, legend (if the user is on a device with a small screen/window), resetting the map, and references. The instructions thoroughly explain all of the features so that the user can easily utilize the map’s interactive features. The map also an interactive widget where users can type in a location or click a location on the map and find the nearest healthy food option, as well as view all nearby food providers in a given radius. The widget then displays a marker (from leaflet) which displays a “This is your geocoded location!” message. The user can also click on a location of their choice where a leaflet marker will pop up and displays a “This is your clicked location of interest.” message. On the left side, the user can also click on the tool icon to find information based around a given location (either via typing in an address or clicking a location on the map). The user can click either within .25, .5, or 1 mile within the chosen location in order to find the Potentially Less Healthy/Unhealthy:Healthy Food Choice Ratio, as well as the Nearest Healthy Option. The distances represent access in a sense, with .25 mile being 5 minute walk where most users do not need a car, .5 mile being a 10 minute walk where some users may need a car, and 1 mile being a 20 minute walk, with many users requiring a car.

There are several ways this map can be improved and further built upon. I think for further improvement, it would be interesting to see “healthier” restaurants to be visualized as such. While hovering over some of the restaurant markers, I saw restaurants such as Subway and Jimmy John’s so I wondered if restaurants that offer healthier options (i.e. vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, etc.) are still categorized as “Unhealthy or Potentially Less Healthy.” This would probably involve a lot more research so I also understand if it is not an option. Another point of interest would be socio-economic factors (such as income, race, etc.) and how those may affect access to healthier food options. This could be done by accessing ACS data and using a choropleth to visualize these factors. Another possible feature on top of this would be the ability to filter businesses based on their categories (fast food restaurants vs grocery stores, unhealthy vs health options, etc.).

## Connection to Other Readings

Researching further on this topic could lead to a more extensive practice of critical cartography. Furthermore, reframing this project as a story surrounding health and social issues would fall into Carton et al.’s statement of critical cartography that anybody is able to create compelling and powerful claims. Carton et al. also talks about how critical cartography has been elevated in recent years due to accessibility to computers and an internet connection. While the original Lexington, KY Foodscape Mapping Project doesn’t necessarily come with any strong claims, they can easily be created using the project as an introductory framework. With the additions I’ve talked about previously, there could be strong claims made about food inequity within the Lexington, KY area. It also doesn’t have to be created by the original author of the project; it could be made by anyone who has basic understanding of how to make a map and access to the appropriate software. Even without these additions, the map is implicitly a very political statement as some areas have more healthier options than others which can help stir action in local communities.

## Pros and Cons
This map has a lot of positives. It is accessible on multiple devices (both desktop and mobile), and allows users to further understand their access to food. It may also be a look into food deserts across Lexington, KY and where healthier resources should be constructed. It also has the extremely convenient “Locate Nearest Healthy Option” that local residents can use to find their nearest grocery store. It could also be a resource for companies who want to expand their business in the area and see which areas are underserved and have less competition.

I think something the map fails to address (which is a very large factor in buying food) is cost. It is easier and cheaper for a family to buy fast food for dinner than it is to buy ingredients, cook, clean, and generally invest a lot more time into dinner, especially if both parents are working over 40+ hours a week. If the map were to include a price range or rating system, it could also help users have a stronger idea of what is truly accessible to them and their budget. Just because a healthy option is nearby, doesn’t mean it is a viable option. Barriers of cost, time, and money are still extremely prevalent in eating healthy. Also, as I have mentioned before, the lack of scale bar and basemap make it impossible to truly understand the distances between these establishments.

## Conclusion

Overall, the Lexington, KY Foodscape mapping project is a great introduction to educating residents about the healthy food options near them, and taking the first step in assessing their eating habits. It is accessible to users on multiple platforms and is simple to use and understand. The interactive widgets are also useful in educating users, and come with instructions in case the user is unfamiliar with the project. The project could of course improve and grow in different ways, whether it’s adding a price range system or adding socioeconomic factors into the mix, it could be built into a stronger asset for not only the residents of Lexington, KY, but for shaping local public policy and increasing access to healthy options for all populations within the area.
